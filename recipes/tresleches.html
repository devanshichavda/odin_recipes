    <p>Strawberry Tres Leches is an ideal summertime dessert. Strawberry milk is blended with three milks and then poured over a light and airy sponge cake until it’s all absorbed. The result is a sweet and delicious cake that’s full of flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Strawberry milk</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9×13-inch pan and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a stand-up mixer with paddle attachment, beat egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow and double in volume. Mix in the vanilla and the milk on low speed just until combined, then fold the egg yolk mixture into the flour mixture.</li>
      <li>Clean and dry the egg yolk bowl. Add the egg whites and beat with the whisk attachment on high until stiff peaks about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Fold the egg white mixture into egg yolk and flour mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.</li>
      <li>Using a skewer or fork, create little holes on the top of the cake. Pour the strawberry milk mixture over the cake (it may seem like a lot but it will absorb!). Transfer to the fridge to 2 to 3 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
      <li>Just before serving, make the whipped cream! To a bowl, using an electric mixer, mix the heavy cream and sifted powdered sugar. Top the cake with the fluffy whipped cream and garnish with slices of strawberry. Slice and serve.</li>
